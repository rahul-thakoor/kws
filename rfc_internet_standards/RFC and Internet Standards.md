# Request for Comments and Internet Standards

## Introduction

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[1] is a non-profit organization. It oversees the development and promotion of Internet Standards such as  the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). TCP/IP itself is a set of communication protocols. But how are these protocols standardised? This article discusses Request For Comments(RFCs) and how they can become Internet Standards. 

## Request For Comments

A Request For Comments(RFC)[2] is a publication authored by engineers. A RFC describes methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet. Steve Crocker, part of the team that developed the protocols for the ARPANET, created RFC  in 1969 to help record unofficial notes. There are three RFC subseries- Best Current Practice (BCP), For Your Information (FYI) and Standard (STD).

Each RFC is given a unique serial number. Once assigned and published, an RFC cannot be rescinded or modified. If the requires modifications, the authors must publish a revised document. Older RFCs then become obsolete.
