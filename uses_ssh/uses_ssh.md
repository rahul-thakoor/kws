# Some uses of Secure Shell

## Introduction
SSH is a network protocol originally designed by Tatu Yl√∂nen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, as a replacement for earlier protocols such as TELNET, ftp and rlogin. SSH version 2(SSH-2) is a revised version of the protocol by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). SSH is primarily favoured over other protocols since it uses public-key cryptography to provide a secured connection. SSH uses the client-server model. While SSH has numerous uses,in this article we are going to illustrate some other common ones such as Remote Login,  Tunneling, Port Forwarding and File Transfer.
