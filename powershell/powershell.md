# Powershell equivalents for some common unix commands

## Introduction

Powershell [1] is a task-based command-line tool and a scripting language. Originally developed for Windows, on 18 August 2016 Microsoft open sourced Powershell with support for other platforms such as macOS and Linux. Powershell uses the "Verb-Noun" syntax for commands which are known as _cmdlets_. In this article we are going to introduce some powershell cmdlets for common unix commands.

## Getting help
On unix systems, the command `man` gives help on a specific command. Powershell provides help for cmdlets through the `Get-Help` cmdlet.
